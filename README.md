Problem:
Waiting in lines all day long, no idea when they move, no idea until you go to a business if it's busy

        - Dynamic info (person per minute info) (average wait time) (early book/pause my spot?)

    Business:
        - Live feed of line status
        - Manage line dynamicly (VIP customers?)
        - Direct message

All with a simple QR code
